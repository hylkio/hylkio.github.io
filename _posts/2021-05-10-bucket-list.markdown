We have passed about 1/3 of the year 2021. I guess that I am a bit late with this bucket-list thing but there we go. I have seen many peoples making these bucket-list posts on their blog website and it made me want to create this, so here it comes.

### Get 500 followers on Twitter till the end of the year

My first, goal for the year has been up from the beginning of the year and I've worked quite hard to accomplish this. I have a specific strategy for this and it is the following:

- Publish content daily and keep it useful
- Quantity > Quality, but anyways try to post quality content but it is not so important
  - I am completing this through using different scheduling tools as like [Buffer](https://buffer.com)
- Engage with other people on Twitter, especially with bigger accounts that have lots of followers

So, if you want to help me to complete this goal, feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sopanenm). I appreciate it a lot!

### Become an intermediate level programmer

The most important goal of mine is to become an intermediate-level programmer by the end of the year. This is something I've wanted a lot recently but I haven't had the motivation to work on this. Now my motivation levels are back on the top again and it is good.

Some languages I want to work with are Python and Rust, but I will choose Rust as my main language of choice. Another important stuff is projects I want to create. Here is a list of projects I want to get done:

- CSV-editing application as a CLI
- Todo-list app which stores data locally and runs on localhost
- Some cool back-end server application

To complete this biggest goal of mine I have to work a lot and stay motivated. To stay accountable on this I share daily my progress on Twitter.

### Cycle at least 5000 kilometers

Some random goal in this time. I have cycled a lot recently, especially during the last summer. Also, cycling has been for a few years my only sport hobby so this is the only goal for sport-category.

### Become a better writer

Becoming a better writer takes a lot of work and I am currently working on that, by writing this [blog](https://sopanem.github.io/blog). I think that through being a good writer I will start becoming a better worker in the future.

I have always been interested in writing and I would like to write a book at some point in my care. Also, blogging, writing articles, and writing thoughts on paper have been always interesting for me.

There is no specific level of writing I want to get into, but this goal is for becoming a better writer in general.

### Speak and write English fluently

During the time we live, English has begun more and more important skill to owe. Knowing the basics of English and being able to speak it is good and useful, but doing it like a fluent speaker is more useful.

I think this skill will open many new doors for me. In the business world, working in general and in school. My ways to complete this are quite simple. Here is a list of my techniques:

- Write a blog and articles
- Speak as much as possible in English
- Listen to content in English instead of Finnish
- Not using subtitles on videos or movies
- Engaging on Twitter with the audience in English

### Conclusion

I believe that I will complete most of these goals by the end of the year but I have to work hard to get there. Although, I think I will learn a lot neither I won't complete any of these
