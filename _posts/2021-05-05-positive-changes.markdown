In the beginning, I would say that learning to code and learning other technical skills has no downsides or negative impacts on my life. All impact it has made for me is positive.

I started learning to code a few years ago during a class programming and I was about 14 or 15-years old then. I started learning Python and I created some small apps and exercises in classes. If I have to describe the interest level of the mine, I would say that it was the highest possible one out there. I was so interested that I used my all free time to read programming-related books and so on.

I have the same interest level today as well as I had then. Although, my learning methods were not the best ones. I started to learn coding through reading books, writing it on paper, and trying to memorize pieces of code. Those were my biggest mistakes I regret.

If I could start from the beginning, I would learn through making my projects to be sure I learn all required concepts as well as possible. Also, this is something I suggest for everyone new in the field of coding. Do your projects you are passionate about.

So, when it comes to things coding has affected positively in my life, I'll list some of them down below:

- Common technical skills and knowing something about tech have helped at school and home.
- It has increased my usage of English and that is how it has helped me to learn it as a non-native English speaker.
- Becoming better at problem-solving.
- I have started to become better at mathematics and understanding the concepts there.

The list could go and go further but there are some of the most important ones I wanted to share today. So, I would suggest you, everyone, take look at the coding field in general and see the positive changes in your life almost instantly.
