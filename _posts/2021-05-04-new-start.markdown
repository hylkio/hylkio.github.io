I am starting today a new experiment. The next 30 days I'll be posting a blog post every day. Topics of posts depends on what I am thinking about during the day but sometimes they might be on topics related to tech and programming.

The biggest reason for this experiment I am starting today is that I want to create a habit of writing and I want to get better in that. I think there aren't any other ways to do that than writing daily something and publishing it on the internet

On the Austin Kleon's book "Show your work" he says that:

> Social media sites are the perfect place to share daily updates. Don’t worry about being on every platform; pick and choose based on what you do and the people you’re trying to reach.

This thing has resonated me to share daily something on the internet and becoming better on that.

So, during the next 30-days you can find new blog posts on my blog. I don't have any specific time I publish but you can except posts becoming published between 4pm. - 10pm.
