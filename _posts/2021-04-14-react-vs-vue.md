title: React vs Vue - A real tight comparsion between the two
---

Javascript, one of the used programming languages in the world, has taken a place in many developers' tech stack. There are various reasons for that but one of the biggest ones is good front-end frameworks. For example, there are ReacJS, VueJS, Angular, and Next.js.

In this blog post, I will cover everything you need to know about two of the most popular Javascript frameworks: VueJS and ReactJS. I'll answer the following questions: Which one you should choose as a beginner when to use it and what are the differences between them. Also, I will cover the pros and cons of both frameworks.

## What Javascript frameworks are?

A JavaScript framework is an application framework written in JavaScript. It differs from a JavaScript library in its control flow: A library offers functions to be called by its parent code, whereas a framework defines the entire application design.
When it comes to the question that do we need to use javascript frameworks, there is no specific answer for that. But, I think that those frameworks are useless if you do only simple page personal websites or something like that. If your webpages are more likely web applications or a little bit more complicated ones, it will be the right choice to use some of the javascript frameworks.

In the following, I will go through two of the most popular frameworks of javascript: Vue and React.

## Vue

Vue is the choice of mine when it comes to developing websites and web apps using javascript and its frameworks. The reason is simple. I don't know javascript as well as possible so using Vue will be the better choice.
Learning Vue does not require you to go so depth into javascript and that is why I recommend it to use for beginners. Also, Vue does have fewer features to learn than React so it is easier to learn as a beginner programmer.

### Hello World application in Vue

```javascript
<div id="app">{{ message }}</div>;

var app = new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {
    message: "Hello World!",
  },
});
```

### Pros:

- Easier to learn than React
- Simple syntax
- Good for small simple page websites

### Cons:

- Fewer features than React has
- Not good for really large or complicated web apps

## React

React is the most popular javascript framework out there. It is used by many developers. It is developed by Facebook.

React is a little bit more complicated than Vue but it is not "too complicated" to learn. I have personally looked out for React but as a beginner, I've found Vuejs as a better choice.

There is also a javascript framework related to React which is React Native. React Native is basically React js but for creating mobile apps.

### Hello World application in React

```javascript
import React from 'react';

  return (
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  );
};

export default HelloWorld;
```

### Pros:

- Plenty of useful features
- Use of JSX
- Good for large web apps

### Cons:

- Quite difficult to learn as a beginner
- Sometimes can be too complicated
