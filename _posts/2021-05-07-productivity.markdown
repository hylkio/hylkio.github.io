When this pandemic started and we were forced to stay home in lock-down.We were affected to stay productive during working remotely.

During the time many YouTubers and other people started to talk about productivity and the importance of it. Never before something like that has happened within as large wide.

I am one of the millions of humans who are trapped in this hook. I started watching a lot of content related to productivity and how to increase productivity levels in general. It was all the same in different formats or different publishers. There were nothing special take-aways out there. Just boring and useless theories.

No, I don't talk against productivity in general. I just talk against giving pressure on productivity for the audience and people who don't need it more and more.

We procrastinate by watching these useless videos or reading their articles. Creators know it and that is how they get watch time and AdSense through getting humans trapped into a trap they have created.

Today's blog post is a little shorter than usual because my schedule is so tight. A bit longer posts coming for the following days. See you!
