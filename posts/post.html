            <p>
              In the journey of learning programming, we usually do something
              better not to do. Those things usually happen to lead you into
              problems and in the worst case, they will make you give up.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here is my list of things you should not do while learning to
              code:
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Comparing yourself to other people</h2>

            <p>
              This is a really important one and it fits in many different
              situations. If you are starting to play football, it is not good
              to compare your skills for example to Cristiano Ronaldo who has
              played so much more time than you. <br />
              <br />
              When it comes to programming, do not compare your skills to a
              person who has made programming lots more than you. See this
              quote:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              "Don’t Compare Your Chapter 1 To Someone Else’s Chapter 20".
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              The person who has reached level 20 has been at some point where
              you are now, I mean at chapter 1.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">
              Switching between different languages and technologies
            </h2>

            <p>
              This is something I have been made during my learning-to-code
              journey. I switched between windows and Linux, different code
              editors and terminals, color schemes, and so on. I find that
              switching harmful nowadays. <br />
              <br />
              I find myself thinking this many times "If I wasn't switched too
              often those systems and if had have had used that time wisely for
              learning the actual coding, I would be quite good today". So,
              there is a warning. Do not switch between technologies while you
              are learning. Learn the current first and then switch!
            </p>

            <p>
              Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one
              man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which
              mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of
              human development.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Giving up too easily</h2>

            <p>
              Again another point that comes from my own experience. Don't give
              up too easily even it feels too hard. I fond me doing this and it
              has affected negatively my whole learning experience. If I could
              change this away from my history, I would do it. Just take those
              hard projects and assignments to complete. If you can't do them by
              yourself, ask for help. When you at some point get it done, you
              can be proud of yourself that you have been accomplished it!
            </p>

                alt=""
              />
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >To go places and do things that have never been done before –
              that’s what living is all about.</span
            >

            <h2 class="section-heading">Trying to memorize code</h2>

            <p>
              Memorizing or trying to memorize code is quite commonly seen made
              by beginners. But when it comes to facts, it is not useful to
              memorize them. It many times doesn't fit into your current task
              and then it is not useful to memorize.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Not googling</h2>

            <p>
              This follows the earlier point "trying to memorize code" because
              many beginners think they need to know everything and that is why
              they don't use Google to search for solutions for problems. Again,
              this was something that led me into giving up too easily. I did
              not search for solutions from Google, I tried to solve them by my
              short experience.
              <br />
            </p>

            <p>
              These are my 5 things not to do during learning to code. I hope
              you found this useful! See you next week on another blog post.
