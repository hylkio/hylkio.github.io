Hi There :wave ! I am Miro Sopanen and welcome to read my a little humble description about me. So, first of all, I am a programmer hobbyist, high school student on days and entrepreneur on nights.

Currently, I am really interested on the following topics:

- [ ] Programming in general
- [ ] Data Science

The most of the content on my blog is related to topics of my interests but some changes may happen.
Through my own experiences I like to share some tips and advice on some interesing topics and helps by the way of that.
